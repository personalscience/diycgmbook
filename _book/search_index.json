This book will explain how to get started. Before you buy one of those expensive kits from one of the many commercial companies that offer the devices as part of their diet and nutrition programs, learn how to do it yourself for about $30 - $50. All of the direct-to-consumer kits use the same FDA-regulated device that is available at your local pharmacy for fraction of the price.
