\chapter{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is among the most exciting personal science experiments you can conduct on yourself. This book will explain how to get started.

Before you buy one of those expensive kits from one of the many commercial companies that offer the devices as part of their diet and nutrition programs, learn how to do it yourself for about \$30 - \$50. All of the direct-to-consumer kits use the same FDA-regulated device that is available at your local pharmacy for fraction of the price.

This site will show you step-by-step how to get the same results as the expensive products: an instant look at your glucose levels at any time day or night. After that, you can decide for yourself it it's worth it for you to buy the other services.

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

This is a list of resources useful for building products that work with continuous glucose monitoring devices. Consider this document to be in the public domain, free to use however you like (but of course with absolutely no guarantees of accuracy).

\chapter{How to get your CGM}\label{how-to-get-your-cgm}}

The FreeStyle Libre is available over-the-counter at most pharmacies throughout the world (including Mexico and Canada), but requires a doctor's prescription in the United States.

A month's supply of sensors costs under US\$100, so don't bother trying to get your health insurance to reimburse you unless you have a specific medical reason, in which case consult your doctor.

There are three ways to get one in the US:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Ask your doctor to prescribe one for you. The \href{https://www.freestylelibre.us/support/buying-guide.html}{Freestyle Buying Guide} gives detailed information about how the product works, and what to tell your doctor. Most doctors will be happy to prescribe it if you explain that you'll be paying out of pocket.
\item
  \href{https://tastermonial.com/products/cgm-freestyle-libre}{Tastermonial} will connect you with a doctor who can provide a prescription for \$29. This is the easiest solution for most people.
\item
  If you're traveling to Canada, Mexico, or other countries, you can pick them up locally, or you can order one to be shipped into the US. \href{https://octern.medium.com/how-to-get-a-continuous-glucose-monitor-d48cd229e9ac}{Michael Cohn} describes how he got one from Canada for about \$100
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{what-to-buy}{%
\section{What to buy}\label{what-to-buy}}

Buy the 14-day sensor by itself. If you have an iPhone 7 + or an Android, don't bother buying the Reader (which is an additional US\$200).

\hypertarget{companies-and-cgm-based-products}{%
\section{Companies and CGM-Based Products}\label{companies-and-cgm-based-products}}

Several companies will give you a month's worth of CGM with an app and nutrition advice for under \$500. See \protect\hyperlink{bookmark=id.d7g3e8qlegnl}{link below}.
