# How to get your CGM

The FreeStyle Libre is available over-the-counter at most pharmacies throughout the world (including Canada), but requires a doctor’s prescription in the United States.

A month’s supply of sensors costs under US$100, so don’t bother trying to get your health insurance to reimburse you unless you have a specific medical reason, in which case consult your doctor.

If you need a prescription, the[ Freestyle Buying Guide ](https://www.freestylelibre.us/support/buying-guide.html)gives detailed information about how the product works, and what to tell your doctor. Most doctors will be happy to prescribe it if you explain that you’ll be paying out of pocket.

You may also be able to order one from an online pharmacy:



*   [Edwards Healthcare Services ](https://www.myehcs.com/diabetes/continuous-glucose-monitors/howcgmswork/)will send you two through the mail for $139
*   [Michael Cohn](https://octern.medium.com/how-to-get-a-continuous-glucose-monitor-d48cd229e9ac) describes how to get one from Canada for about $100

Buy the 14-day sensor by itself. If you have an iPhone 7 +  or an Android, don’t bother buying the Reader (which is an additional US$200). 

Numerous companies will give you a month’s worth of  CGM with an app and nutrition advice for under $500. See [link below](#bookmark=id.d7g3e8qlegnl).
