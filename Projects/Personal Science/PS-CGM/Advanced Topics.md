## Hardware




### Freestyle Libre hardware information



*   [Freestyle Libre sensor teardown](http://idoroseman.com/freestyle-libre-blood-glucose-monitoring-system-teardown/): Blogger Ido Roseman takes one apart, with photos.
*   Reddit forum [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/670qbw/librelink_and_the_s8/): “it would appear that Libre sensors use NfcV, while S8 does not support NfcV (ISO 15693) but happily talks over NfcA and NfcB (ISO/IEC 14443). “
*   Insulin calculator: settings/professional and password  = CAA1C


### Freestyle-compatible 

Hardware devices that work with the Freestyle Libre. Using an NFC reader that talks directly to the Libre sensor, they send information to a bluetooth phone.



*   **[MiaoMiao](https://miaomiao.cool/)** Shanghai company $200 
*   **[Ambrosia Systems Nightrider](https://www.ambrosiasys.com/)**:  $110 NFC-to-bluetooth device
*   **[Bubblan](https://www.bubblan.org/)**: Supports All Libre Sensors except US Libre2 version : 139.99€
