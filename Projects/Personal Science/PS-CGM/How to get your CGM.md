# How to get your CGM

The FreeStyle Libre is available over-the-counter at most pharmacies throughout the world (including Mexico and Canada), but requires a doctor's prescription in the United States.

A month's supply of sensors costs under US\$100, so don't bother trying to get your health insurance to reimburse you unless you have a specific medical reason, in which case consult your doctor.

There are three ways to get one in the US:

1.  Ask your doctor to prescribe one for you. The [Freestyle Buying Guide](https://www.freestylelibre.us/support/buying-guide.html) gives detailed information about how the product works, and what to tell your doctor. Most doctors will be happy to prescribe it if you explain that you'll be paying out of pocket.

2.  Tastermonial ([tastermonial.com](https://tastermonial.com/products/cgm-freestyle-libre)) will connect you with a doctor who can provide a prescription for \$39 (or [\$195 including shipment](https://tastermonial.com/products/glucose-experiment-kit) of two sensors). This is the easiest solution for most people.

3.  If you're traveling to Canada, Mexico, or other countries, you can pick them up locally, or you can order one to be shipped into the US. [Michael Cohn](https://octern.medium.com/how-to-get-a-continuous-glucose-monitor-d48cd229e9ac) describes how he got one from Canada for about \$100

## What to buy

Buy the 14-day sensor by itself. If you have an iPhone 7 + or an Android, don't bother buying the Reader (which is an additional US\$200).

## Commercial CGM Products

Several companies will give you a month's worth of CGM with an app and nutrition advice for under \$500.
