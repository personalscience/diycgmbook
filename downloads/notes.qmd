## Hardware




### Freestyle Libre hardware information



*   [Freestyle Libre sensor teardown](http://idoroseman.com/freestyle-libre-blood-glucose-monitoring-system-teardown/): Blogger Ido Roseman takes one apart, with photos.
*   Reddit forum [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/670qbw/librelink_and_the_s8/): “it would appear that Libre sensors use NfcV, while S8 does not support NfcV (ISO 15693) but happily talks over NfcA and NfcB (ISO/IEC 14443). “

### Freestyle-compatible 

Hardware devices that work with the Freestyle Libre. Using an NFC reader that talks directly to the Libre sensor, they send information to a bluetooth phone.



*   **[MiaoMiao](https://miaomiao.cool/)** Shanghai company $200 
*   **[Ambrosia Systems Nightrider](https://www.ambrosiasys.com/)**:  $110 NFC-to-bluetooth device

<div class="raw"><p class="date-box">How_to_get_your_CGM</p></div># How to get your CGM

The FreeStyle Libre is available over-the-counter at most pharmacies throughout the world (including Mexico and Canada), but requires a doctor's prescription in the United States.

A month's supply of sensors costs under US\$100, so don't bother trying to get your health insurance to reimburse you unless you have a specific medical reason, in which case consult your doctor.

There are three ways to get one in the US:

1.  Ask your doctor to prescribe one for you. The [Freestyle Buying Guide](https://www.freestylelibre.us/support/buying-guide.html) gives detailed information about how the product works, and what to tell your doctor. Most doctors will be happy to prescribe it if you explain that you'll be paying out of pocket.

2.  Tastermonial ([tastermonial.com](https://tastermonial.com/products/cgm-freestyle-libre)) will connect you with a doctor who can provide a prescription for \$39 (or [\$195 including shipment](https://tastermonial.com/products/glucose-experiment-kit) of two sensors). This is the easiest solution for most people.

3.  If you're traveling to Canada, Mexico, or other countries, you can pick them up locally, or you can order one to be shipped into the US. [Michael Cohn](https://octern.medium.com/how-to-get-a-continuous-glucose-monitor-d48cd229e9ac) describes how he got one from Canada for about \$100

## What to buy

Buy the 14-day sensor by itself. If you have an iPhone 7 + or an Android, don't bother buying the Reader (which is an additional US\$200).

## Commercial CGM Products

Several companies will give you a month's worth of CGM with an app and nutrition advice for under \$500. 

![Levels Health](images/levelshealth-logo.png "Levels Health")

<https://www.levelshealth.com/> offers "metabolic health" services, including a month's supply of CGMs and nutritionist consultation for about \$400/year. They'll sell additional sensors "at cost".

![January, Inc.](images/january-logo.png "January.AI Logo")

<https://january.ai/> \$300 2-week program includes 1 Freestyle Libre device and an app to guide your eating, fasting, and exercise choices. The app claims it will predict your glucose levels after that using their "virtual CGM".

![Nutrisense](images/nutrisense-logo.png "Nutrisense Logo")

<https://www.nutrisense.io/>: Join their "cohort" and receive 2 CGM devices/month and 24/7 nutritionist advice with an app that tracks your glucose, fasting, and more.



![Aspect](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e185e46d27bcfd7730106db/61ae83248735897617fec36f_logo.svg) 

[Aspect Health](https://aspect-health.com/) focuses specifically on women's metabolic health. You can get their "21 Day Assessment", which includes an app, a metabolic report, and a coaching session for /$200.

<div class="raw"><p class="date-box">Using_Your_CGM_Data</p></div># Using Your CGM Data

Websites and apps that help you track glucose numbers.

## Use the Personal Science App

The best way to analyze your CGM data is with the CGM app from Personal Science (makers of this web site). You can upload your data and study it for free using the open source software [here](https://github.com/personalscience/taster).  Uses Docker.  Requires a little setup, but it will let you upload a CSV file and generate plots like this:

![](images/glucose_Levels_After_Eating_Rice.jpg)


## Abbott Labs Official

The most important software for Freestyle Libre downloading is the officially-supported one here:

<https://provider.myfreestyle.com/freestyle-libre-resources.html>

Create an account on Libreview and then you can download your data as a CSV file here:

<https://www.libreview.com/meter>

![Libreview main page](images/freestyle-download.jpg "image_tooltip")

Then click here: <https://www.libreview.com/glucosereports>

![Click to download](images/freestyle-download-click.jpg "image_tooltip")

If you have the Abbott custom reader device, you can also download a Mac or Windows version of Freestyle Libre personal CGM

![Freestyle Libre Software](images/freestyle-software.png "image_tooltip")

## International versions

Freestyle Libre devices sold in other countries will generally work everywhere if you use the app downloaded specifically for that country.

This [table by [Chuck Kub](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1835069433269419&set=gm.751003141928341&type=3&theater&ifg=1)] is a little old, but gives a sense of which models are available in which countries.

**China:** buy a reader plus 3 14-day sensor packs [through Taobao](https://item.jd.com/32498232197.html) for about 1800 RMB (USD\$270)

## Third Party

Many organizations now offer ways to upload and use your Freestyle (or other CGM) data.

# Prerequisites

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is among the most exciting personal science experiments you can conduct on yourself. This book will explain how to get started.

Before you buy one of those expensive kits from one of the many commercial companies that offer the devices as part of their diet and nutrition programs, learn how to do it yourself for about \$30 - \$50. All of the direct-to-consumer kits use the same FDA-regulated device that is available at your local pharmacy for fraction of the price.

This site will show you step-by-step how to get the same results as the expensive products: an instant look at your glucose levels at any time day or night.  After that, you can decide for yourself it it's worth it for you to buy the other services.
